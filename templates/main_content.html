  <h2>Document Database Wizards</h2>
  <p>
      To streamline the process of working with large collections of documents, the Research Assistant Chat includes powerful wizards that activate scripts to find, upload, and create a database based on the type of documents you choose. These wizards automate the task of collecting, organizing, and indexing your documents, allowing you to efficiently manage and access your entire document repository.

      The wizards work in conjunction with the research assistant, utilizing advanced techniques such as document classification, keyword extraction, and metadata analysis to intelligently process and structure your document database. They help to facilitate comprehensive searches, contextual analysis, and cross-referencing, enabling you to harness the full potential of your document collection.
  </p>
  <h2>Offline Functionality</h2>
  <p>
      While the Research Assistant Chat currently operates online, there are plans to introduce offline functionality in the future. Offline functionality would enable you to securely process and analyze documents locally on your own machine or private infrastructure, ensuring data privacy and allowing for sensitive or confidential content to be processed without being transmitted over the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
      The offline functionality would provide enhanced flexibility and control, particularly for users with strict data governance requirements or limited internet access. It would enable you to harness the power of the research assistant while keeping your data within your own environment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Stay tuned for updates on the availability and implementation of the offline functionality, as it will further expand the capabilities and versatility of the Research Assistant Chat.
