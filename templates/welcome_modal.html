          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>Welcome to Research Assistant, a powerful tool designed to enhance your research experience. Whether you're conducting business intelligence analysis, performing gap analysis research, exploring PhD research ideas, or any other research endeavor, this tool is here to support you.</p>
  
          <h5>Public and Private Modes</h5>
          <p>Research Assistant offers both Public and Private modes, allowing you to customize your research experience based on your needs. In Public mode, you can access a vast repository of open-source methods and libraries, ensuring transparency and collaboration in your research process. However, it's important to note that the use of OpenAI APIs may incur costs and introduce slight differences in accuracy, depending on the complexity of your queries.</p>
  
          <h5>Data Privacy</h5>
          <p>One of the key advantages of Research Assistant is the option to keep your research data in-house. By ingesting documents into the local database, you can maintain full control over your sensitive information and ensure data privacy. This feature is particularly valuable for professionals such as doctors, lawyers, government officials, professors, and students who handle confidential or proprietary data.</p>
  
          <h5>Additional Features</h5>
          <p>Research Assistant goes beyond being a document chatbot; it offers a wide range of additional features to facilitate your investigations. For instance, you can leverage graph generators and statistical measures to gain deeper insights from your data. While Research Assistant significantly accelerates investigations and provides valuable assistance, it's important to note that it doesn't replace the need for human investigation and research. Instead, it serves as a valuable tool to expedite your research process and enhance your productivity.</p>
  
          <h5>Supplementary Features</h5>
          <p>Moreover, Research Assistant provides supplementary features tailored to your specific needs. You can utilize an in-house wiki for organizing and accessing research materials, and a client report investigator for generating comprehensive reports based on the ingested documents. These additional capabilities make Research Assistant a versatile tool that caters to various professional domains and research disciplines.</p>
